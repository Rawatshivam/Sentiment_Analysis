 **How to Run This Project (Locally)**
Step 1: Install Python & Dependencies
Then install the required packages:
pip install tensorflow numpy

Step 2: Place Files in One Folder
Ensure the following files are in the same folder:
sentiment_model.h5
tokenizer.pkl
predict.py

Step 3: Run the Sentiment Prediction Script
